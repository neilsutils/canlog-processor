    Bongo Tool can be used load/extract and examine the contents of one or more stores.  In addition,
    Bongo Tool maintains data within the store that is used to indicate that a store has been exported, indexed 
    and when the store was created.  These values can be view in 'Bongo Console', 'Bongo Manager' and 
    'Bongo Explorer'.  
    
    Essentially, 'Bongo Command' can import and export files of any size, whilst 'Bongo Manger' is designed for files 
    the import and export of files less than 100G in size.  Note that this restriction does not apply
    to 'Bongo Navigator'.
